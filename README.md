# Word-Guess-Game

initial array list of word choices:
var randomWordChoices = ["bicycle", "derailleur", "saddle", "handlebar", "wheel", "pedals", "brakes", "bell", "spokes", "chain", "saddle", "top tube", "crank arm", "bottom bracket", "spokes", "fork", "tire", "kickstand"]

I  have gotten to the point of validating the guesses and pushing the incorrect and correct guesses to the DOM. Final steps --> log wins and losses and reset game. 
Then redo code to make it more streamlined with using functions.

I have been reworking the .js script multiple times to gain the functionality.

I did get the psychic game to work first; getting hangamen to work has proven more of a challenge.
