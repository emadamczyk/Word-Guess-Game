# Word-Guess-Game

initial array list of word choices, which I shortened to just a few words for initial testing:
var randomWordChoices = ["bicycle", "derailleur", "saddle", "handlebar", "wheel", "pedals", "brakes", "bell", "spokes", "chain", "saddle", "top tube", "crank arm", "bottom bracket", "spokes", "fork", "tire", "kickstand"]

When I got to the point of validating the guesses and pushing the incorrect and correct guesses to the DOM, I knew my final steps would be to log wins and losses and reset the game. 
My hopes are to continue to rework this code to make it more tigher and better, using more functions and possibly objects.

Throughout this process I reworked the .js script multiple times to gain the functionality (these are also uploaded to the github repo under different .js file names).

I did get the psychic game to work first; getting the word guess to work proved to be more of a challenge.
